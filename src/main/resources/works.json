While highly situated in a particular city, this work also has international qualities: Automated train announcements are not, themselves, unique to Tokyo, and the odd, disjointed world that these generated texts evoke could resonate with the novels of Márquez as much as with those of Murakami. As simple as these automated statements are, they are consistent with the discourse of magical realism by announcing bizarre, unreal occurrences with complete nonchalance. They also ask the reader to participate in the curious projected world by making requests, politely giving (impossible) instructions. The text generation in both versions is accomplished by a simple JavaScript program which can be studied and even modified by the intrepid reader of code; the addition of text-to-speech output provides an experience similar, in terms of media channels, to that in the station.</p>",

    "editorialStatement" : "<p>In <cite>bacterias argentinas </cite> Colombian digital artist and data visualization developer Santiago Ortiz creates a linguistic-multicellular environment that models the interactions between basic organisms in a virtual ecosystem. In Ortiz’s words, it is “a dynamic model of autonomous agents that remix genetic information by consuming one another, and in which genetic information is narrative.” In this Flash work, Ortiz explores the question of life as information by mapping linguistic elements onto color-coded “bacteria” that circulate freely in this bio-linguistic ecology. These bacteria carry changeable fragments of sentences as “genes”—they exchange genetic material upon accumulating or losing energy through phagocytosis (the feeding method of many microorganisms)—and their feeding redistributes energy in the community, since the consumed bacteria cedes its energy (measured here in terms of the length of its genetic code) to the bacteria that consumes it. In this way, the interaction between bacteria, whose feeding strings together narratives within the bacterial community, provides materia prima for metabolic processes that write narratives and also for the decomposition of bacteria whose genetics are not favorable for the narratives, thus constituting a kind of “natural” selection. This is, however, an “un-natural” selection process, according to Ortiz, since it models a principle of “infinite injustice” that Ortiz equates with neoliberal political and economic policies. It is significant that the bacteria are “Argentine,” recalling that country’s devastating 2002 financial crisis. The user can confirm their nationality by moving the cursor over each bacteria, hearing the constructed narratives recited by the Argentine “storyteller” Edgardo Franzetti.</p>",

    "editorialStatement" : "<p>Netprov is an emerging category of performance art, taking place primarily on social media networks with participants collaborating to produce a shared and emergent narrative. However, when communicating online through serialized and dispersed platforms, the boundaries between fiction and nonfiction are less stable, and those who come in contact with netprov are not always aware that they are even readers in the first place. <cite>Reality: Being @spencerpratt</cite> unfolded when reality television star Spencer Pratt (already established on Twitter with nearly one million followers) agreed to allow Mark Marino and Rob Wittig to take over his account. Through his tweets, they told a story of star’s cell phone being lost, or perhaps stolen, and discovered by a struggling poet who takes over the account in order to use it as a platform to promote poetry. Unsure of whether this was fact or fiction, Pratt’s fanbase suddenly found themselves entangled in a world of Oulipian games and early modern English poetry. The result of this intervention into the quotidian life of a reality television celebrity with a lively group of followers is that <cite>Reality: Being @spencerpratt</cite> may be one of the most read and interacted with works of electronic literature (albeit in scattered glimpses of 140-character posts). This project calls into question the assumptions about authenticity and identity that take place on social media platforms. In the end, how different are the performative utterances of <cite>Being @SpencerPratt</cite> from those normally published from the “verified” identity of @spencerpratt? Marino and Wittig’s repurposing of a celebrity identity offers a compelling example of the unreliable narrator in an age of social media and the unexpected reactions that this mode of digital storytelling can inspire when a tiny bubble of fiction is dropped into everyday life.</p>",

    "editorialStatement" : "<p><cite>The Brain Drawing the Bullet</cite> takes as its point of departure William S. Burroughs’ infamous murder of his wife Joan Vollner as a means to explore the multi-voicedness of editorial intervention. Recalling works like Mark Z. Danielewski's <cite>House of Leaves</cite> which depict a series of editors whose insertions trace their psychological deterioration over time as they fall victim to the hermeneutic black hole of their subject matter, <cite>The Brain Drawing the Bullet</cite> tells the story of an ersatz editor who invests so deeply in his research that he is led down the same violent path. The body of the text and the text as body chiasmatically intersect to produce an uneasy alignment between author, editor, and reader. Not only is Burroughs’ cut up method a textual ancestor to the aleatory and hypertextual processes of electronic literature, but the footnote and editor’s annotations are also a print precursor to the hypertext node. Trotter’s piece is elegantly simple, yet takes advantage of the medium-specific affordances of working with the digital screen rather than printed page. The series of first-person accounts of the shooting interleaved with editor comments not only unfold through this mode of hypertextual annotation, but the writing on the screen does not remain fixed. With each click forward, marking a passage through 110 days of increasing mania, small yet significant mutations allegorize the unreliability and capriciousness of memory.  Sigmund Freud famously described the mind as a “mystic writing pad” and this text draws and redraws Burroughs’ bullet, each insertion simultaneously marking a point in time and rewriting the past through the distorted focus of an obsessed editor.</p>",

ITC Conduit was based on the letters on ordinary signage done by a non-professional. Mark van Bronkhorst took the regular but awkward forms and added his experienced sense of design and proportion ... and in the process broke almost every rule. The forms were made with a grid, “like the 90 degree corners in real conduits with all the tips and corners rounded off.” A few optical corrections produced ITC Conduit, a fairly narrow, square and highly legible sans serif typeface (source: <a href=”http://www.linotype.com/700/mark-van-bronkhorst.html” target=”blank”>LinoType.com</a>).</blockquote><p>The video poems use a series of animations and techniques evocative of 1990s animated GIF works, 2000s Flash poetry, and contemporary kinetic typography videos. Varied in tone, strategy, and messages&mdash; yet held together by a consistent font that gives it its title&mdash; these poems collectively invite reflection on the human condition in the digital age.</p>",

Written for VR as a performative medium, it was composed in three movements and arranged for collaborative performance between solo user and CAVE interface. The text is a response to the seduction of VR spectacle: periphery, reactivity, stereoscopy, depth and immersion. These poetic texts were encountered in new combinations each performance. In this documentation of \"Movement 1: When the Eye\", Asmina Chremos dances the physical gesture of reading through the interface of the CAVE. Her exquisite movements focus on the discrepancy between what is read by the dancer wearing the tracking glasses and by the audience (a concept which echoes the reality that Canticle’s CAVE piece and video documentation are different perspectives/projects). Midway through the performance, text is programmed to evade Chremos’ line of sight. Text only remains legible to the outside audience and within her peripheral vision.</p>",

    "editorialStatement" : "<p>Brown University’s CAVE was one of the earliest places that made use of 3D immersive technology and virtual reality in order to produce literary art rather than spectacular experiences or scientific experiments. Yet, one of the difficulties is remediating these “CAVE writings” in non-CAVE environments. The unique phenomenological effects of embodied 3D vision are always lost when translated into a 2D screen. <cite>Canticle</cite> plays precisely with this space of incommensurability and untranslatability. The fantasy of unmediated immersion and pure spectacle is allegorized as an unattainable erotic object of desire in Gorman’s work. Rather than experience the immersion of the CAVE, <cite>Canticle</cite> displays Asmina Chremosa, a live dancer wearing a CAVE headset whose every attempt to interact with text is resisted. As a result, only the audience outside the CAVE can experience the words flickering across the the walls and eluding Chremosa’s vision. The work is designed to be seen not from within, but from without. Mixing Gorman’s poetry with computer processed verses from the bible’s <cite>Song of Solomon</cite>, the result if a love story between bodies and texts, readers and writers whose desire for access is never entirely fulfilled. Much like the biblical verses it displays, this is a work that can only experience after having been processed through a complex series of translation, adaptation, and remediation.</p>",

While the dissemination of text is not typically indexed to a physical referent, <cite>Channel of the North</cite> offers a contemplative moment when poetry becomes a vehicle for exploring the relationship between the flow of geological processes, the flow of networked computation, and the flow of language. Nicole Starosielski’s <cite>The Undersea Network</cite> charts the long relationship between water and networked communication based on how the subterranean network of private undersea cables are connected to a history of empire, colonialism, and geopolitical conflict and commerce. These undersea undulations between channels of water and data find poetic expression in Baeke and Marseille’s work as the Westerschelde is made to flow through an interconnected network of oceanic and electric currents.</p>",

The dizain is a French poetic form, a 10-line stanza traditionally of a fixed number of syllables in each line, with a typical rhyme scheme of a-b-a-b-b-c-c-d-c-d. Here, Bénabou has altered the form: each line is an Alexandrine, a line of 12 syllables, in which two halves of 6 syllables each are separated by a caesura. And the poem consists of 6 pairs of rhyming lines. In the generation of each dizain, the lines are permuted such that each pair can be separated by 0, 1, or 2 other lines. These 10 lines, rearranged according to this metric, provide 145,920 possible dizains. \"Dizains\" is part of a tradition of such permutational poetry, which here takes advantage of the capabilities of computational systems to re-order the lines automatically. In the translation, as much of the meaning of the lines as possible is preserved, along with their ability to be reordered, though the verse loses the metrical qualities of the original.</p>",

The game begins by first procedurally generating an expansive, dynamic world in which players attempt to guide an exponentially increasing colony of temperamental dwarves to build and manage within an ever expanding fortress. The task is made difficult by both the unpredictable and emergent behaviors of the simulation as well as by the anachronistic and arduous interface: a screen full of ASCII characters recalling the personal computers of the early 1980s. Inspired by games like <cite>Rogue</cite> (1980) and <cite>Sim City</cite> (1989), the stark textual interface contrasts with the game's complexity as <cite>Dwarf Fortress</cite> can easily consume all available processing power of a contemporary computer. Stephanie Boluk and Patrick LeMieux have suggested that \"[i]n rejecting the conventions of standard game design and traditional narrative storytelling, <cite>Dwarf Fortress</cite> produces textual inscriptions that not only mark one horizon of human experience but recall forms of historical writing that depart from human-centered and teleological modes of history.\" The way in which <cite>Dwarf Fortress</cite> generates a flattened narrative landscape in which no moment is prioritized over another is reminiscent of medieval literary forms of writing such as the annal, chronicle, and calendar. While the game's textual output may or may not aggregate into narrative coherence, a dedicated community of players have delighted in not only playing the game to observe its effects, but they have also translated these nonhuman narratives into legible (if absurd) stories as a means of inscribing a history of play that is notoriously difficult and governed by the game's tagline \"Losing is Fun.\"</p>",

    "editorialStatement" : "<p>Zuzana Husárová and Ľubomír Panák’s <cite>Enter:in’ Wodies</cite> makes use of the Kinect, an interface developed by Microsoft for so-called natural body control. This concept of controlling interaction with the entire body is central to the piece, as the reader first chooses a gendered body with which to explore the work, and then interacts through using movement to uncover the words hidden in each of seven sections of the body. The relationship between text and body is fundamental to the piece: the work invites the player to intimately explore these avatar bodies and eventually to leave them behind. The reliance on the player’s movement to reveal the words results in a fragmented text: with some effort, only sections of a word or letter are visible, and significant physical movement is required to reveal the rest of the text.</p><p>This is a work that benefits from a fully embodied performance that matches voice with movement. Reading the text silently leads to guessing words and reconstructs an approximation of the text in the mind. Reading out loud forces reader to perform poetic lines that have been revealed by a swipe of a hand across the work’s surfaces. Robert Pinsky’s assertion that “in poetry, the medium is the audience’s body” focuses on how “grunts and mouth-noises have been used as the materials for art” (<cite>The Sounds of Poetry</cite> 8). By using the Kinect to bring a human body into the feedback loop, <cite>Enter:in’ Wodies</cite> makes us aware of how these technologies can extend this poetic medium beyond the vocal tract.</p>",

Through layering its source files, the algorithm keeps Heldén’s style alive while building works the artist likely would not have imagined: its potential for mimicry is limitless, and the artists set forth in their proposition for the piece the goal of creating works that feel crafted by human hands. The piece suggests that a procedural generator can become an extension of an artist’s voice, tuned by exposure to the artist’s particular style and combining text and audio elements in an emergent poetics.</p>",

This publication has curated four different versions of this work. One version is the original DSK file of the 1984 edition which can be opened with an Apple II emulator. This version includes the AppleSoft BASIC source code as a text file and scanned images of the printed matter that accompanied the original 5 1/4 inch floppy disks on which <cite>First Screening</cite> was distributed. The second version is a video of the first version. Also included is a 1993 HyperCard version, ported by J. B. Hohm, along with the printed matter of that published edition. Finally, there's a JavaScript version ported by Marko Niemi and Jim Andrews. For most readers, we suggest the JavaScript or video versions which lovingly recreate the screen performance. For those who wish to explore bpNichol’s code within an antique operating system and programming language, we recommend the emulated version. Those curious about the role of editorial interventions, media archaeology, and later versions of <cite>First Screening</cite> may be interested in the Hypercard adaptation. The project also includes essays on bpNichol and his work by Andrews, Huth, Kearns, and Waber.</p>",

      "statement" : "<p><cite>High Muck a Muck: Playing Chinese</cite> troubles the cliché of historical tales of Chinese immigration to North America’s “Gold Mountain” by juxtaposing this classic narrative of struggle against one of mobility driven by the exigencies of contemporary global capitalism. Disrupting a charming world of hand-painted graphics and traditional Chinese music is the winking gleam of a highly adaptable, well-monied, digital class. The project expresses some of the internal community struggles that erupt between different generations and classes of immigrants and it challenges the racist paradigm of an all white Canada into which Asian immigrants enter but are never fully allowed to arrive. </p><br><br><p>The piece is a result of a collaboration between eleven writers, artists and programmers and was created over three years from 2011-2014. Embedded within the website are eight videopoems. The work was created in HTML 5. </p><br>",

    "editorialStatement" : "<p><cite>High Muck A Muck: Playing Chinese </cite>is the product of a sustained collaboration between an interdisciplinary group of artists who, over a period of three years, shared, responded to, and transformed each other’s work. Its experimental, dialogic, and mixed form of sound, poetry, video, and interactive text reflects the larger themes of <cite>High Muck A Muck </cite>-- a deep engagement with issues of racism, intercultural exchange, imitation, history, economics, and Chinese immigration to Canada. While the interactive poem is a local expression of the complexities of power, culture, and migration in Canada, the artists situate their work in a larger conversation surrounding global diaspora. The use of handcrafted text, traditional instruments, and the sensuality of the body are translated into an oneiric digital environment in which space and time, past and present are mapped on to each other in often uneasy co-existence and psychogeography. <cite>High Muck A Muck’s </cite> poetic and fragmented dreamscape challenges the myths of immigration and fantasies of success promoted by the often disingenuous rhetoric of Canadian multiculturalism.</p><p>This work was the winner of the 2015 New Media Writing Prize.</p>",

    "editorialStatement" : "<p>Poetry knows no bounds. In <cite>LETTERS FROM THE ARCHIVERSE</cite>, Jeff T. Johnson and Andrew Klobucar have created a memory palace of poetry in AutoCAD, a popular computer-aided design platform traditionally used to render engineering schematics and architectural blueprints. A program designed to place points, lines, and curves within the abstract geometry of Cartesian space, AutoCAD also renders text as a series of vectors. Rather than the bitmapped, rasterized text of PhotoShop or Microsoft Word, AutoCAD’s font faces are generated from complex sets of mathematical equations. As such, they can be blown up, stretched out, squashed down, and zoomed in with no information loss. Software that was never intended as a platform for creative writing is pushed, pulled, and prodded into something inbetween a word processor and a rendering tool--concrete poetry imagined at both macro and micro scales like a literalized version of Marcus Novak’s “liquid architectures in cyberspace.” In the <cite>ARCHIVERSE</cite> there are letters you can walk in, letters you can step on, letters that penetrate the membranes of the body and slip through the cracks in the negative space between atoms. The result is an eccentric textual topology that recursively drills inward and outward, producing a multidimensional and multiscale universe of poetry. This innovative use of AutoCAD is not without its pitfalls. By exploiting the software in unexpected ways, the result is conflict from the limitations of the physical processing power of contemporary computers and the Platonic abstractions of this blueprint. Thus, as the title suggests, the letters arrive to the reader as envoys from a computational space which exists beyond the horizon of both human and nonhuman reading capacities. The architectural (and architextual) abstractions of language are rendered into concrete poetry but <cite>LETTERS FROM THE ARCHIVERSE</cite> is always in excess of this computational materiality. <cite>LETTERS FROM THE ARCHIVERSE</cite>’s spatial orientation and nesting along a field of micro and macro granularity goes far beyond the constraint of typesetting on a page. Potentially, the entire archiverse could be embedded in either a period or on a Borgesian map of the world that is not only as big but even bigger than the world itself.</p>",

Known for his experimental work in “ambient literature,” Tan Lin’s <cite>Mastering the Art of French Cooking and Systems Theory</cite> playfully juxtaposes two textual tomes known for their complexity against one another at supra-human reading speeds. The indigestible speed of this piece reflects the difficult and often inscrutable subject matter of the original works. Whereas Julia Child’s cookbook contained baroque recipes that exceeded the expectations of Americans accustomed to Betty Crocker basics. Luhmann's systems theory is itself written in deliberately abstruse language. Both works attempt to argue for the importance of interconnectedness, whether it’s the careful attention to complicated multi-step, multi-ingredient processes or a vast interconnected communication network. In <cite>Mastering the Art of French Cooking and Systems Theory</cite>, Tan Lin networks these two narratives together, hinting at larger forms of interconnectedness&mdash;a homology between the quantified abstractions of food recipes and the abstraction of cybernetics in a computational environment operating at the limits of human sensibility. </p>",

Recalling experimental photographs like Glenn Ligon’s <cite>Hands</cite> (1996), <cite>my hands/wishful thinking</cite> draws together the hand of the artist, the hand of Diallo, and the hand of the user navigating the web page. Mendi and Keith Obadike begin with the premise that \"thoughts are things\" and for every shot fired a thought has been written down as an act of poetic resistance. Released in an age before social media, <cite>my hands/wishful thinking</cite> exemplifies the transformative potential of the Internet at the turn of the millennium.

    "editorialStatement" : "<p><cite>Oczy Tygrysa</cite> (<cite>Eyes of the Tiger</cite>) is an example of an online flash adaptation of the poems of an avant-guard poet (formist) from the interwar period, Tytus Czyżewski.The authors of the adaptation, poet Łukasz Podgóni and electronic literature researcher Urszula Pawlicka chose to adapt Czyżewski’s pieces that speak explicitly to issues of mediation and mechanization. Czyżewski’s poetry serves as a precursor to the forms of aesthetic experimentation now common in electronic literature, anticipating hypertextual, interactive, generative, and kinetic forms of writing. The inspiration for this adaptation was the paraphrased words of Mark Amerika “What would Czyżewski the Formist do with new media?” <cite>Oczy Tygrysa</cite> shows how interwar poetry complements the language of new media both in terms of composition as well as semantics.</p>",

Growing up in Knoxville, TN, I made frequent visits to the Smokies, and the traversal of Pigeon Forge (rarely stopping except for gas or maybe at the Arby's by the last red light) was a familiar and impressive spectacle. In Montfort's HTML, the text color is expressed with the value, \"#dad,\" which in CSS could also have been written as #DDAADD, \"rgb(221,170,221),\" or \"rgb(87%,67%,87%).\" Writing it \"#dad\" saves time and characters, but of course may also suggest fatherhood. Whether intentional or not, this also motivates my interest in Pigeon Forge and the Smokies because of the many, many trips I've taken through there with my father. For my version of the poem, I populated the variables with the signifiers of Pigeon Forge: its geology, its audience, its history, its peculiarly linear composition and its economic history. The poem's subtitle, \"Action Packed,\" is the town's motto, which appears on the entrance and exit signs along the highway. The sidebar links to other works derived from <cite>Taroko Gorge</cite>, and my title links to a google image search for \"Pigeon Forge\", the imagery which helps convey <cite>Pigeon Forge</cite>'s simulacra of white Appalachian culture. </p>",

The dreams were strange, but comfortable, even comforting. The human mind, ever plastic and adaptive, works with whatever input it is given. If saturated with abstractions it will grapple with them, naturally, forging neural patterns mirroring their structures. I was disturbed by the dreams. I began thinking about how illusory the notion is that we can experience things, especially for many hours on a regular basis, without becoming them, without patterns of expectation and memory becoming irrevocably imprinted with them. But it also seemed true that an experience or memory or network could remain distinctly 'other' (or 'artificial') at the same time it became centrally integrated with the self, mapped into the self's map, employed as part of the self.

Hatcher’s recursive signature transforms from first-person identity to programmable variable to the “1” of binary information.

    "editorialStatement" : "<p>When homes are stormed after their residents unwittingly perform simultaneous searches for terms like <em>backpacks</em> and <em>pressure cookers</em> simultaneously and the NSA deploys programs like PRISM and XKeyScore to scrape the internet for possible threats to national security, Ben Grosser’s <cite>ScareMail</cite> makes innovative use of the browser extension to produce an aesthetic intervention into the culture of fear dictating governmental dataveillance. Working with a database of keywords that have been deemed suspicious by the Department of Homeland Security, ScareMail procedurally recombines these cursed words in order to produce a block of text that can be appended to any email. As each procedurally generated text is unique, it cannot be filtered out by the NSA’s algorithms. By trafficking in forbidden language and adding noise to the search parameters of governmental surveillance organizations, <cite>ScareMail</cite> asks the reader to think about the relationship between language, intent, self-censorship, free speech, and hacktivist forms of political action. Rather than opting out of the network and online exchange, this radical opting in exploits the nonhuman capacities of procedural text generation, gesturing towards a future in which the government is compelled to monitor a parliament of chattering bots, exchanging a constant barrage of threats against the security of the state. <cite>ScareMail</cite> suggests that it is not these words that are scary, but a system that has grown in which concept of privacy and anonymity now feel like a quaint memory.  </p>",

Unlike many other works in the <cite>Taroko Gorge</cite> collection, Judy Malloy’s piece omits the traditional list of other authors and interpretations, and with that change invites us to see Nick Montfort’s code not as a poem awaiting remix but as an authoring system open for many types of generative manipulation.</p>",

    "editorialStatement" : "<p>As Emily Dickinson famously wrote, “the brain is wider than the sky.”  What happens when you combine the lyric interiority of Emily Dickinson poetry with the sprawling encyclopedic seascape of Herman Melville’s <cite>Moby Dick</cite>? Stephanie Strickland and Nick Montfort’s collaborative exploration of code poetry sets adrift two of the most famous literary figures from the nineteenth century within a media platform unmoored from the linear constructs of print. Using the tools of digital humanities for aesthetic as much as analytic effects, <cite>Sea and Spar Between</cite> produces a lattice of texts mapped to various nautical coordinates. Their writing is unmoored from the printed form in order to set sail along a sublime digital seascape in which their words swirl and blend together. With a flick of the wrist, mouse pointer moves and causes a ripple across the onscreen text as the specific coordinates of the cursor recombine elements of a database into millions of poems. Like the ocean, this map is not infinite. Although the specific points of this textual leviathan are determinate, they still far exceed the reading capacities of any single human. As Montfort and Strickland write, the reader must surf a work “populated by a number of stanzas comparable to the number of fish in the sea.” <cite>Sea and Spar Between</cite> allegorizes the relationship of the reader to a digital sublime. Montfort and Strickland demonstrate how the massive scales of computer data far exceed human phenomenology. One particular edition, “cut to fit the toolspun course” also includes a lengthy analysis of the work in the comments section of the code, demonstrating how the front and backend of the piece— surface and depth— are inextricably entwined. Should readers want to examine them, they should access the glossed code of the file. <cite>Sea and Spar Between</cite> stands out not only as a playful poetry generator, but also as an incredibly robust critical code study and text analysis that examines the relationship between the technical and aesthetic properties of the piece and its historical predecessors.</p>",

The audio defies easy interpretation, which is appropriate given the text’s own emphasis on the importance of hearing rather than understanding: “The meaning of the messages doesn't matter to me, only that they are speaking, and though I will never know for sure, they speak to me, so I record the numbers.” The work is web-based and driven by HTML, JavaScript, PHP, and CSS.</p>",

The masterstroke in this variation is the use of the “path” function in the code. In Montfort's version, this line of code produces a small possibility for a monkey to appear within the forest landscape whereas Burgess' applies this moment of statistical rarity to surprise the reader with “myocardial infarction.” The endless consumption of unhealthy food, which even continues past the random heart attack in <cite> Tasty Gougère</cite>, serves as a reminder of how the gourmand in all of us can only roll so many dice before our bodies run out of luck.</p>",

      "statement" : "<p>An email from the author to Kevin Hehir in 2003 explains her work: My website is called \"Tipoemas y Anipoemas\" (Typoems and Anipoems), and it contains my visual poetry works. I will explain this name.</p><p>Many years ago I wrote \"Typoems\", a series of visual or typographic poems which I typed with an old machine called Lettera 22. Typoems were limited by one fixed font, the size and position of the page on the typewriter, and the black ink ribbon.</p><p>In 1997, I bought my first computer and started \"Anipoems\" or animated visual poems for the Internet. These at first maintained most of the restrictions of the earlier Typoems: they never exceeded the size of the screen, so you did not have to scroll up and down, they were in one font only, and until 2000, they were all in black and white.</p><p>And sound? Sound did not really matter in these early Anipoems. Most of them could be understood without it. Sound became important in mid 2001, in pieces such as \"The Circus\", \"A Busy Day\", \"Discipline\" and \"Deseo - Desejo - Desire\".</p><p>These more recent works also begin to have a plot, however simple it may be. There is a timeline with a starting point, a climax and a denouement. \"A Busy Day\" depicts one day in the life of Mr. @. In \"Discipline\" the \"h\"'s (a letter which in Spanish is always mute) are tyrannized by a dictator. In \" Deseo - Desejo - Desire\" - a trilingual \"erotic\" Anipoem - the letters \"s\" and \"i\" in \"desire\" join in a tango dance, forming the Spanish word \"si\" (=yes), in apparent acceptance. However, on a second reading, \"si\" in Spanish also means \"if\", so success should not be taken for granted after all.</p><p>In Anipoems, the main components are typography and motion, in that order. And once motion is added, rhythm becomes all important, since I work with repetition and short sequences of elements.</p><p>Typography and words - as in the old Typoems - are still the main elements, since the letters themselves are my source of inspiration. They project themselves into the world around me and they act upon it, and not, as much, the other way around, as one might be led to believe.</p>",

Her tools were very basic: sequencing typographic images into animated GIFs to create simple animations that breathed life into letters.

The triolet, a French poetic form from the Middle Ages, consists of a poem of two stanzas with the rhyme scheme a-b-a-a a-b-a-b. As an additional constraint, line 1 is repeated at lines 4 and 7, and line 2 is repeated at line 8. In the generated triolets, the repeated lines are correctly preserved. This more intricate verse structure thereby benefits from the computational form over the original paper presentation of Queneau's work. In the translation, the rhyme scheme is preserved such that with some variations in pronunciation (e.g., ballet as BA-let) all outputs are valid triolets. This also required the alteration of some place names to preserve as much as possible the sense of the original French. Metrically, however, the French remains more pleasing and euphonous.</p>",

File 2 allowed for Boolean logic and File 3 was generative. The work is part of some of the first discussions of the potential for software as art and draws on Judy Malloy’s experience in database programming. It makes use of a node-based model of molecular narrative units that, when combined, allow for non-sequential storytelling.

Follow this bot on Twitter to learn many new euphemisms for sexual acts and the expressive potential of conceptual reframing.</p>",

Based on photographs and sound recordings taken from the same window over the course of a year, <cite>Window</cite> seeks to capture a sense of space for readers to enter.

Norman creates minimalist interfaces so that the reader can visually and aurally explore the space over time while also remixing them with custom soundscapes. The code for this poem is worth looking at and it doesn’t take a programmer to appreciate how its design elegance extends to its source code. <cite>Window</cite> was the winner of the 2012 New Media Writing Prize.</p>",

    "editorialStatement" : "<p>Porpentine’s <cite>With Those We Love Alive</cite> is a Twine game that invites the reader to become physically involved through marking up their own body with symbols throughout play.  As a Twine game, the work relies primarily on text and audio along with backgrounds of shifting colors to draw the player into a disturbing science fiction landscape. The game opens with a level of customization that invites the player to become connected and even embedded into the game, choosing their month of birth, element, and eye color. As the player becomes a servant to a monstrous larval queen, the stage is set for a dystopia of dream-like and vivid yet mundane violence. After playing, the reader has a tangible record of their own choices and identity beliefs in the drawings on one’s skin.  </p>",

The original publication of <cite>ZAM</cite> is accompanied by a theoretical text on the <cite>Mutantisme</cite> blog which further engages with Bey's ideas from \"Manifesto of Poetic Terrorism.\" <cite>MAZ</cite> puts in to practice Bey’s philosophy of public street art protest: “Grafitti-art loaned some grace to ugly subways & rigid public monuments - Poetic Terrorist art can also be created for public places: poems scrawled in courthouse lavatories, small fetishes abandoned in parks & restaurants, xerox-art under windshield-wipers of parked cars, Big Character Slogans pasted on playground walls…” <cite>MAZ</cite> recalls textual street projects such as Truisms (Jenny Holzer), Bubble Project (Ji Lee), Implementation (Nick Montfort and Scott Rettberg), and Logozoa (Robert Kendall). While the focus of Renderings is the translation of computational writing into English, <cite>MAZ</cite> was included as an interesting exception, one in which the language of the original work&mdash;although not deeply worked on by computation&mdash;is situated in particular physical spaces, and on a blog, and needs to be not only translated but \"reimplemented\" in some other unusual ways. The signs have been translated to English by Patsy Baudoin and Nick Montfort.</p>",
